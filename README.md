# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The manager has tasked me with the assignment of determining the number of retiring employees on a per-title basis, and to identify eligible employees for the mentorship program geared at having employees close to retirement status mentor younger hires.

## Resources
-Data sources: schema.sql, departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
-Software: pgAdmin 4 5.2 (PostgreSQL 12.7)

## Results
Through the analysis I conducted with SQL, I was able to find that: 
-A total of 90,398 employees are slated to retire within the next three years.
-The job position slated to yield the largest number of retirees during that time is Senior Engineer, projected to shed 29,414 employees to retirement.  Just behind that is the job position of Senior Staff, expected to lose 28,254 employees to retirement within said time span.
-Taken together, projected retirements of employees from these two job positions constitute almost two-thirds of the overall number.
-1,549 employees were flagged for mentorship program eligibility.

## Challenge Summary

In the next three years, a total of 90,398 employees will be eligible for retirement, and almost two-thirds of them will be
